# Git Issue Activity

Activity for practicing with Git branching, GitHub issues and merge requests, and Kanban flow.

For this activity, the students will practice making changes to a GitHub repository. 
The repository has a text file that has been "scrambled" - meaning that random words
have had their characters randomly rearranged, and considered to be issues to be fixed.

The misspellings were generated by the `twiddle.py` program and then entered as issues by the `report.py` program (from this [git-twiddler fork](https://github.com/kwurst/git-twiddler).

## Prereqisites

1. Git installed and configured on your computer.
2. GitHub account created and username emailed to professor.
3. Invitation to class organization on GitHub accepted.
4. SSH key added to GitHub account.

## Set up for In-Class Activity

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:

    `git remote add upstream git@github.com:cs-worcester-cs-348-sp-2020/Git-Issue-Activity.git`

   Check the remote connections with the command:

   git remote -v

### 1. Assign yourself to an issue on GitHub (e.g. Issue #42)

1. Go to the project board:[https://github.com/cs-worcester-cs-348-sp-2020/Git-Issue-Activity/projects/1](https://github.com/cs-worcester-cs-348-sp-2020/Git-Issue-Activity/projects/1)
2. Click on Git Issue Activity
3. Click on `+Add Cards` on right side of panel for Git Issue Activity. It will show a drop-down of all Open Issues (is:open). Move any open issue to `To Do` column (Drag and drop).
4. Assign yourself to an issue that is unassigned.
5. Move the card from `To Do` to `In Progress`.

### 2. Work on the issue on your computer

1. Make sure you are on the Master branch: `git checkout master` 
2. Pull any changes that have ocurred since your last pull, and correct merge conflicts `git pull upstream master` 
3. Create a branch named for the issue (e.g. `issue-42`), and switch to that branch: `git checkout -b issue-42` 
4. Edit the `LICENSE` file to correct the issue
5. Add the change
6. Commit the change, with a message describing the change (include line number and correction, e.g. `Correct misspelling, line 1: UGN -> GNU` )
7. Pull any changes that have ocurred since your last pull, and correct merge conflicts `git pull upstream master` 
8. Push the change `git push origin issue-42`

### 3. Make a pull request on GitHub

1. On GitHub, make sure you are on your fork, then switch to the newly pushed branch (e.g. `issue-42`)
2. Click the `New Pull Request` button.
3. Include in the pull request text a notation that it closes the assigned issue (e.g. `Closes #42`)
4. Click `Create Pull Request`
5. On the project board, move the card for your issue from `In Progress` to `Waiting for Merge`.

### 4. Review and apply a merge request

1. If the `Pull Requests` tab shows any pull requests waiting, click on the tab.
2. Select a pull request from someone else, and click on the title. (Never merge your own pull requests! A pull request should be reviewed by someone other than the person who created it.)
3. Click on the commit message (below the comment - you will see the commit number to the right) to view the commit.
4. You will see the differences.
   1. If it looks correct: 
      1. Click on `Review Changes`.
      2. Select `Approve`.
      3. Click `Submit review`.
      4. Merge the pull request.
      5. The card will automatically move to `Done` because the issue has been closed.
   2. If it looks wrong:
      1. Click on `Review Changes`.
      2. Make a comment suggesting a correction.
      3. Select `Request changes`.
      4. Click `Submit review`.
      5. The person who made the merge request will be notified.
